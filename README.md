This project demonstrates a **production-grade DevOps CI/CD pipeline** for deploying a **containerized Node.js application** to Microsoft Azure using modern cloud-native technologies.

The pipeline automates the full application lifecycle:

Code → Build → Security Scan → Containerize → Push → Deploy → Monitor

# 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline Flow

1️⃣ Developer pushes Node.js code to GitHub

2️⃣ GitHub Actions CI pipeline starts automatically

3️⃣ Application build and tests run

4️⃣ Trivy scans the container image for vulnerabilities

5️⃣ Docker image is built

6️⃣ Image pushed to Azure Container Registry

7️⃣ Application deployed to Dev environment

8️⃣ Manual approval required for Production deployment

9️⃣ Production deployment executed

🔟 Monitoring and logs collected via Azure Monitor

# 🔵🟢 Blue-Green Deployment Strategy

Azure Container Apps supports **revision-based deployments**, enabling safe releases without downtime.

Traffic can be gradually shifted between versions.

Example traffic distribution:

| Revision       | Traffic |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Stable Version | 90%     |
| New Version    | 10%     |

After validation:

| Revision    | Traffic |
| ----------- | ------- |
| New Version | 100%    |
| Old Version | 0%      |

Rollback can be performed instantly by switching traffic back.

# 📊 Monitoring & Observability

Monitoring is implemented using **Azure Monitor** and **Log Analytics**.

Metrics available:

* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Request metrics
* Replica count

Logs available:

* Node.js application logs
* Container runtime logs
* System logs

Example Log Analytics query:

```
ContainerAppConsoleLogs_CL
| limit 50
```

# 📦 Infrastructure as Code

Infrastructure resources are provisioned using **Terraform**.

Provisioned resources include:

* Azure Resource Group
* Azure Container Registry
* Azure Container App
* Log Analytics Workspace
* Managed Identity
* RBAC Role Assignments

Terraform state is stored remotely using **Azure Storage backend**.

# 🛠 Operations Runbook

## Restart Container App

```
az containerapp revision restart --name devops-app-prod --resource-group devops-gha-rg
```

## View Application Logs

```
az containerapp logs show --name devops-app-prod --resource-group devops-gha-rg
```

## Check Active Revisions

```
az containerapp revision list --name devops-app-prod --resource-group devops-gha-rg --output table
```

## Rollback Deployment

```
az containerapp ingress traffic set --name devops-app-prod --resource-group devops-gha-rg --revision-weight devops-app-prod-0000001=100
```

## Monitor Metrics

Key metrics available:

* CPU usage
* Memory usage
* Request rate
* Replica scaling

---

# 🔒 Security

Security scanning is implemented using **Trivy**.

The CI pipeline scans Docker images for vulnerabilities and blocks deployment if critical issues are detected.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible enterprise enhancements:

* Canary deployments
* Automatic rollback based on health checks
* Prometheus & Grafana integration
* Multi-region deployment
* GitOps workflow using ArgoCD
* Automated alerting
